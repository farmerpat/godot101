to get pixelated sprites:
  in inpsector:
    ImageTexture
      - click flags
        - uncheck filter

  gobally:
    ProjectSettings
      ImageLoader
        - uncheck filter

when you re-implement pong
  do it with both
    KinematicBody2d physics ("arcade physics")
    RigidBody2d physics ("natural? physics")

aggregate RM ideas its repository!
  the his descent (e.g. robes darkening, also the existential piece)
    contrasting with the "ascention" of his targets
    e.g. level 1: targets are scumbag murderers (maybe its in a prison or something)
         level n: targets are innocents

  the more pure the baddies, the more damage they can do.
    so in early levels, the harmful "light" they (non-targets)
    emit/fire at you/transfer via contact does less damage

  this brings up the idea of player HP as opposed to one-shot deaths
  or the player losing pieces of himself as he approaches game over.
  really, that might be a possibility..think mario losing his fire power...
